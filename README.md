# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program â€“ Week 1

This repository covers the basics of Verilog simulation using Icarus Verilog, and introduces RTL synthesis with Yosys. It includes tasks such as writing simple Verilog designs and testbenches, running simulations, analyzing waveforms, and synthesizing designs into gate-level netlists.

ðŸ“‚ Each day has its own folder (`Day1`, `Day2`, â€¦) with:
- A `Day<num>.md` file (your notes, explanations, tasks).  
- Any Verilog source (`.v`) and testbench files (`_tb.v`).  
- Screenshots, waveforms, or results (if needed).
